## run with docker run

    docker run --rm -it tophfr/op

## run with my fake op bin command (really a bash script launching docker run for you)

    wget -O $HOME/bin/op https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tophfr/docker-op/master/bin/op
    chmod a+x $HOME/bin/op

then just run `op` like you would with a standard install (without docker)

## run with my bash function

Add this line to you `.bashrc`:

    source &lt;(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tophfr/docker-op/master/bin/bash.function.sh)

(or copy the script somewhere and source it from your `.bashrc`)

then just run `op` like you would with a standard install (without docker) from a new bash session.
